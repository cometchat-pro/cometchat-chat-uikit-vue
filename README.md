# CometChat UI Kit for Vue

The CometChat Vue UI Kit provides a pre-built user interface kit that developers can use to quickly integrate a reliable & fully-featured chat experience into an existing or a new app.


## Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 14.17.0
- npm >= 7

## Getting Started

To set up CometChat Vue UI Kit and utilize CometChat for your chat and calls functionality, you'll need to follow these steps:
- Register at the [CometChat Dashboard](https://app.cometchat.com/) to create an account.
- After registering, log into your CometChat account and create a new app. Once created, CometChat will generate an Auth Key and App ID for you. Keep these credentials secure as you'll need them later.
- Check the [Key Concepts](https://www.cometchat.com/docs/vue-uikit/key-concepts) to understand the basic components of CometChat.
- Refer to the [Integration Steps](https://www.cometchat.com/docs/vue-uikit/integration) in our documentation to integrate the UI Kit into your Vue app.
